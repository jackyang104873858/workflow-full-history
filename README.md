# Sitecore: Workflow Full History

## Overview

The Workflow Full History module displays all the history for each version of an item in a single pop-up.  This expands upon the Sitecore Provided Workflow / History link that only displays history for the current version.

This module adds a **Full History** button to the **Workflow** group under the **Review** tab. The Full History button only appears for items that are participating in workflow.

Clicking the Full History button displays a pop-up with history for each version of the item.
